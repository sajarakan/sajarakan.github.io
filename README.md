# My Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed during my bachelor's degree, focusing on various aspects of data science, including Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), data visualization, Business Intelligence (BI), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and data cleaning. Each project includes relevant files such as Python notebooks, reports, and other necessary documentation that provide background information and detailed explanations.
